# Task Manager Board

Simple application that helps track status of tasks. It offers the possibility of creating boards and inside the boards, tasks can be created or deleted, as well as updating its content. The tasks are structured on three different columns, similar to a Jira board - `To Do`, `In Progress` and `Done`.

Created with ReactJS (create-react-app) and Firebase, styled with SASS.

Future plans:

- create a timestamp and display the date a specific task was created.
- implement `drag-and-drop` to be able to change the status of a task by dragging them around the sections. Additionally, the current status dropdown can be replaced with a "Priority" field.
- implement delete board. Currently once a board is created, it cannot be deleted.
- implement functionality to move tasks from one board to another.
